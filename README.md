## _RemadeLayouts_

---

This repository contains a collection of static websites built using only HTML and CSS, based on design concepts from free templates available at BootstrapMade.

While the structure of these templates is inspired by BootstrapMade, all code has been rewritten from scratch without copying the original source code. The focus was on learning, customization, and achieving full responsive design without relying on JavaScript or external libraries.

Key Features :

- Fully responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile

- Ideal for learning, experimentation, and creative adaptation
